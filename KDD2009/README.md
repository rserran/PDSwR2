# Example code and data for "Practical Data Science with R, 2nd Edition" by Nina Zumel and John Mount, Manning 2019.


 * The book: ["Practical Data Science with R, 2nd Edition" by Nina Zumel and John Mount, Manning 2019](http://www.practicaldatascience.com)
 * The support site: [GitHub WinVector/PDSwR2](https://github.com/WinVector/PDSwR2)


## The code and data in this directory supports examples from:
 * Chapter 5: Choosing and Evaluating Models
 * Chapter 6: Using Memorization Methods


A workspace containing most of the results has been saved as KDD2009.Rdata and can be loaded in R with the command:
```R
load('KDD2009.Rdata')
```
(note you will have to re-load various libraries like ROCR to perform some of the steps).
